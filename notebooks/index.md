These lectures were built using the new Sphinx-based [Jupyter Book
2.0](https://jupyterbook.org/) tool set, as part of the
[ExecutableBookProject](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/en/latest/).  They are
intended mainly as a demonstration of these tools.
Instructions for how to build them from source can be found in the Jupyter
Book documentation.

# About Machine Learning

In this exciting journey, we'll delve into the fascinating world of **Machine Learning** with Python, where machines learn, adapt, and make decisions based on data. Topics that are covered are Linear Models, Kernel Trick, Model Selection, Ensemble Learning, Data Preprocessing and Bayesian Learning. Neural Networks, Gradient Descent and related subjects are disccussed in [Neural Networks Course](https://fum-cs.github.io/neural-networks/).


## Prerequisites

- **Basic Knowledge**: You should have a solid understanding of artificial intelligence concepts.
- **Mathematics**: Advanced topics may require strong mathematical foundations.
- Current students of **MDS** at **FUM University** are acquainted with the concepts covered in the [**FDS Course**](https://fum-cs.github.io/fds/)

## Questions?
I will be having office hours for this course on Monday (10:00 AM--11:30 AM). If this is not convenient, email me at m.amintoosi@um.ac.ir, talk to me after class or [schedule an appointment via Calendly](https://calendly.com/m-amintoosi/30min).

## Our Slack workspace

I should mention that the original material of this course was from [Open Machine Learning Course](https://ml-course.github.io/), by [Joaquin Vanschoren](https://github.com/joaquinvanschoren) and others. I have forked his repository and modified it to suit my own needs and preferences. I would like to thank him for his great work and generosity.
